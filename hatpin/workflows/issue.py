"""GitHub issue implementation workflow.

Defines the stages for implementing a GitHub issue:
1. Comment on issue with implementation plan (+ record structured plan artifact)
2. Add "in-progress" label (mechanical)
3. Create branch (uses plan's branch name if available)
4. Gate: ready to implement? (escape to stage 1)
5. Write tests (red) — skipped if plan says no tests needed
6. Implement (green)
7. Refactor — skipped for docs_only tasks
8. Commit changes (mechanical)
9. Gate: docs needed? (mechanical — checks diffs and docs/ dir)
10. Update docs (conditional — skipped if gate_docs decides not needed)
11. Submit PR (uses plan's pr_title/summary if available)

Stages 12-14 (respond to PR feedback, close issue) are deferred —
they require waiting for external events (PR review, PR merge).
